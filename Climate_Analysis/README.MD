# Surf's Up Challenge

## *Purpose*
### The purpose of this analysis is is to observe weather trends to determine whether or not it would be a successful business in Oahu.
### Temperature and precipitation trends using the data provided. The months of December and June of this past year were looked into specifically when analysing the temperature trends. The precipitation trends were observed on the most active station over the last year.

## *Results*
### * The mean temperature in June was 74.94 degrees and 71.04 degrees in December, respectively
### * The minimum in December was 56 degrees, which was much lower than the 64 in June.
### * The maximum temperature in June was recorded at 85, with December showing a maximum of 83

## *Summary of Results
### The mean temperature for the months were more similar than expected. Although the lowest temperature was much lower in December than in June, the mean does tell us that it is generally warm out. The max temperature was 85 degrees in June, and 83 in December, which means it can get decently hot. 
### Another query that couldve been looked into would have been to observe the temperatures over the last year. We could have filtered the dates to reflect each seasons temperature, which could have painted a bigger picture for the investors.
### The precipitation could have been observed over the last 3-5 years istead of one year. The results could have shown a year over year analysis of the precipitation in each month over multiple years.
